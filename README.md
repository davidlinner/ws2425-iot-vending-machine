# Student Project - Vending Machine

## Get started

Before installing dependencies make sure you created and 
activated a virtual environment for this project.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

In the project root directory create a file named
`.env` and add username and password for the shop API.

    SHOP_VM_USER=<your-user>
    SHOP_VM_PASSWORD=<your-password>

### Execution with PyCharm

Create a run configuration for `src/main.py` and
set the working directory to the project root, not `src`.
Hit the run button.

### Execution on the terminal

Just run the main script from the project root.

    python src/main.py
